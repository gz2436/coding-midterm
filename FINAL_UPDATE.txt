FINAL UPDATE
Last revised: 2025-10-31

Completed tasks:
- Unified the entire site and documentation in English.
- Refined the audio system so every sketch shares the same manager.
- Replaced legacy emoji icons with feather icons and text fallbacks.
- Added swipe, keyboard, and thumbnail navigation for sketches.

Audio playback checklist:
- Landing page loads generative ambience after a short delay.
- Jellyfish, Coral Reef, and Ocean Waves sketches reconnect to the shared audio manager on load.
- Start button triggers the welcome overlay dismissal and unlocks audio.

Quick smoke test:
- Visit http://localhost:8000 and confirm the landing page renders the background particles.
- Press the start button, verify music plays, and check that the control panel becomes visible.
- Open each sketch page using the navigation grid or bottom bar and confirm animations respond.
- Open the About page to review the conservation message and resource links.

Key files touched in the latest iteration:
- index.html and css/style.css for layout, copy, and icon updates.
- js/audio.js and js/navigation.js for audio state handling and navigation logic.
- sketches/*/sketch.js to ensure comments and logs are in English.
- Documentation files (README.md, QUICK_START.txt, PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md, UPDATE_NOTES.txt) rewritten in English.

Next steps if you extend the project:
- Swap in recorded ambience by loading audio files through p5.sound.
- Add thumbnail art for each sketch and update data/sketches.json.
- Optimise particle counts for mobile devices if performance dips.
