OCEAN DREAMS - QUICK START
==========================

Local preview
-------------
1. From the project root run `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in a modern browser.
3. Press the Start button to enable audio, then explore each sketch via the navigation grid or bottom bar.

Project checklist
-----------------
- Landing page with particle background and audio toggle.
- Three standalone sketches: `jellyfish.html`, `coral.html`, and `waves.html`.
- `about.html` summarises the concept and links conservation resources.
- Shared styling in `css/style.css`, shared audio/navigation logic in `js/`.
- `data/sketches.json` contains the metadata that powers the thumbnail navigation.

Interaction cheatsheet
----------------------
- Jellyfish: move the mouse to steer particles, click to trigger chimes, press space to rotate palettes.
- Coral Reef: hold the mouse to attract fish schools, click to pop bubbles.
- Ocean Waves: click or drag to create ripples, press R to reset the field.

Deploy to GitHub Pages
----------------------
1. Push the repository to GitHub (for example `coding-midterm`).
2. In the GitHub UI open **Settings > Pages**, choose `main` as the branch and `/ (root)` as the folder.
3. Wait for the green success badge, then visit `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO/`.

Submission tips
---------------
- Include `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` with your coursework submission as the formal write-up.
- Mention the live GitHub Pages URL and the local test command.
- If audio is muted on first load, note that browsers require an initial click before playback.
