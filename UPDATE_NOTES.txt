UPDATE NOTES
============

Date: 2025-10-31

Resolved issues
---------------
- Fixed the jellyfish sketch by renaming the `colorMode` variable that shadowed the p5.js API.
- Centralised audio handling in `js/audio.js` and added UI controls for play, pause, and volume.
- Replaced remaining emoji icons with feather icons so the UI is consistent and lightweight.

Audio implementation
--------------------
- Each sketch reconnects to the shared `AudioManager` once its script loads.
- Generative ambience uses four oscillators with dynamic frequency modulation and reverb.
- Click and hover cues are generated with dedicated oscillators to avoid loading external assets.

Testing checklist
-----------------
1. Load `http://localhost:8000` and ensure the landing page displays the particle background.
2. Click **Start Experience** to dismiss the welcome overlay and confirm that audio fades in.
3. Navigate to each sketch using the bottom bar; confirm the animations respond and the audio persists.
4. Open the About page and verify that the conservation resources link out correctly.

Browser support
---------------
- Confirmed in Chrome 120, Firefox 121, and Safari 17.
- Mobile Safari runs but benefits from reducing the jellyfish particle count if performance dips.

Next candidates for improvement
-------------------------------
- Add thumbnail art for the navigation cards.
- Provide a mute state indicator directly on the floating audio toggle.
- Ship an alternate audio track that can be enabled through `data/sketches.json`.
