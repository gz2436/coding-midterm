USER GUIDE
==========

Launching the site
------------------
Option 1 (recommended): run `./start.sh` from the project root to start a Python HTTP server on port 8000.

Option 2: use Python manually.
```
cd /Users/gavincheung/Desktop/coding-mid
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Option 3: any static server works, for example `npx http-server -p 8000` or `php -S localhost:8000`.

Important: open the site through `http://localhost:8000`; loading `index.html` directly from the file system will prevent audio from starting.

First visit flow
----------------
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
2. Press **Start Experience** on the welcome overlay.
3. Grant audio permissions if the browser asks for them.

Navigation basics
-----------------
- Move the mouse to influence visuals.
- Click to trigger sound effects.
- Use the bottom thumbnails or arrow buttons to switch sketches.
- Keyboard arrows also switch sketches; press `Esc` to close the control panel if you add that behaviour later.

Sketch reference
----------------
Jellyfish Particle System:
- 20,000 particles updated in real time.
- Space bar cycles colour palettes.
- Click to play a shimmer sound and ripple the swarm.

Coral Reef Ecosystem:
- Procedurally generated corals with swimming fish and bubbles.
- Hold the mouse to attract the fish school.
- Click to launch bubble pops.

Ocean Wave Patterns:
- Layered sine waves with audio reactive amplitude.
- Click or drag to create ripples.
- Press `R` to reset the wave field.

Audio system
------------
- Generative ambience built from four oscillators and reverb.
- Hover and click cues use dedicated oscillators for water droplets and chimes.
- To replace the soundtrack, add a file in `assets/audio/` and swap the synthesis block in `js/audio.js` for `loadSound`.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- **No audio:** ensure you interacted with the page, check the floating audio toggle, and confirm the browser did not block autoplay.
- **Blank canvas:** verify that the CDN scripts are loading; open the developer console for network errors.
- **Performance dips:** lower `POINT_COUNT` inside `sketches/jellyfish/sketch.js` or reduce the number of coral instances.
